- Format (int, float, string)
  For integer types, chains and float the following format is taken into account.
  Example: 
  name = gets.to_s   
  age = gets.to_i 
  price = gets.to_f 
  
- Classes
  The class name must always begin with a capital letter and if you have more than 
  one word, the next word also should begin with a capital letter.
  Example: 
    class MiClass
    end

- Methods
  The method name should always start with a small letter and if you
  have more than one word, the next word must begin with a capital letter.
  Example:
  def myMethod
  end 

- Variables, Getter/Setter
  The variable name should always be in lowercase and if you have more 
  than one word must be separated by a low bar.
  Example:
  my_name, first_name

  Getter/Setter
  In the same way the names of the Getter / Setter variables should be lowercase and separated by a
  low bar if they are having more than one word.
  Example:
  attr_reader my_name
  attr_writer my_name
