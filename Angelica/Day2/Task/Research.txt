Research :
a) The way to add comments on ruby (inline – multiline)
    # This is a  single comment
    =begin 
        This is a multiline
        comment
    =end

b) When you should use each type
   Inline= Is used to put a single line comment
   Multiline= You can span a comment multiple lines, although Ruby programmers 
              rarely use this. They are useful when making notes for documentation.

c) Create and script using inline-multiline comments
     #Scripts for to use print and puts
     puts "printed with line break"
     =begin
     if you want to print without
     a line break,
     use print
     =end
     print "printed with print"
