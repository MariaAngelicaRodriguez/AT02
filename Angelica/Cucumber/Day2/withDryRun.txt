Feature: This is the practice with search customer

  Scenario: Search customer by last name                                   # search_customer.feature:6
    * I have a database full of customers                                  # search_customer.feature:7
    * and sorted by last name                                              # search_customer.feature:8
    * I want to find customers whose last names begin with the letter R    # search_customer.feature:9
    * then you should see the list of clients that begin with the letter R # search_customer.feature:10

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^I have a database full of customers$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Given(/^and sorted by last name$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Given(/^I want to find customers whose last names begin with the letter R$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Given(/^then you should see the list of clients that begin with the letter R$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end
