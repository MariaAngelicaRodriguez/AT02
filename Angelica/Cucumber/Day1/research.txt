Research :
1.- When and why BDD was defined
BDD is a software development process, although it is mainly related to the Testing, which is where arises.
BDD looking for a common language to unite the technical and the business, and it is from this common language from which the Testing and start from there development.

2.- The most important aspects of BDD
The most important aspect is that there is no difference between developers and testers, I is oriented to software behavior

3.- Why is useful and when could be applied.
Collaboration: direct communication PO - DEV qa
Simple Specification: Ubiquitous language
Easy Feedback: changes done on time not the end
Avoid rework in requirements definition
Self documentation
Focus on Behavior

4.- Which type of teams could implement BDD
Teams using agile methodologies

5.- Structure of a feature – Give an example

   Name = insert user 
   Size [Optional] 
   Priority = hight

6.- Structure of a user story – Give an example
Title : Verify that the user to insert does not exist
Narrative:
As the operator I, 
I want to insert a new user that does not exist
so that avoid duplication with this user


7.- Structure of a scenario – Give an example

Feature:  Verify that the user to insert does not exist
	
As the operator I, 
I want to insert a new user that does not exist
so that avoid duplication with this user
	
Scenario: enter user code
Scenario: Blank code



8.- Differences between BDD and BDT
BDT is focused on testing
BDD is focused behavior
